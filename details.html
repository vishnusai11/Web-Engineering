                I first heard the term HTML while i was doing my undergraduate degree. I searched on it and saw some code samples and frankly the thing that got me interested in HTML was it's code structure/syntax.
                It seemed very different than the popular ones like c,c++,python etc. However since my major was in electronics i couldn't take this course back then and so when i found out there was a course i wanted to take it.
                And also a class in web engineering offers an exciting and dynamic learning experience. In today's digital era, where the internet plays a central role in our lives, understanding web development is increasingly valuable. 
                Although i am new to web engineering and websites, I have some coding experience in C, C++, Python, which i have read are used in this field although not as prevalent as languages like JavaScript or PHP

            <p>When it comes to serving and enjoying a delicious pepperoni pizza, here are a few tips for the best experience:

                Freshly baked: Enjoy your pepperoni pizza while it's still warm and freshly baked. The flavors and textures are at their best when the pizza is hot out of the oven.
                Crispy crust: A crispy crust adds a delightful texture to your pizza. Whether it's a thin crust or a thick, doughy one, make sure the crust is well-baked and slightly golden for that satisfying crunch.
                Generous toppings: Pepperoni is the star of the show, so make sure your pizza is loaded with plenty of it. The spicy and savory flavor of pepperoni pairs perfectly with the melted cheese and tomato sauce.
                Dipping sauces: Consider serving your pepperoni pizza with some delicious dipping sauces. Marinara sauce, garlic butter, or ranch dressing can add extra flavor and enhance the overall taste.
                Customizations: Feel free to add your favorite toppings to personalize your pepperoni pizza. Whether it's additional cheese, vegetables, or even some hot peppers for an extra kick, make it your own.
                Pair with a beverage: A refreshing beverage can complement your pepperoni pizza. Choose a drink that suits your preference, such as a cold soda, a glass of wine, or even a craft beer.</p>
